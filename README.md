### Hi there! 👋 I'm Everkeen!

🌟 **About Me**  
I'm a graduate student specializing in **Quantitative Economics** with a strong background in engineering. My research focuses on leveraging **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**, **game theory**, and **economics** to explore real-world challenges like **asymmetric information** and **market policies**.  

📚 **Interests**  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Building intelligent agents for strategic decision-making.  
- **Game Theory Applications**: Modeling and simulating competitive and cooperative scenarios.  
- **Open Innovation**: Combining open-source principles with economic strategies.  
- **Simulation Modeling**: Using real-world data to validate complex systems.  

💻 **Tech Stack**  
- **Languages**: Python, Java, SQL.  
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy.  
- **Tools**: VS Code, Git, Jupyter Notebook.  

🔗 **Connect with Me**  
I'm always excited to collaborate on projects related to **AI**, **economics**, and **policy simulations**. Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories for more insights into my work!
